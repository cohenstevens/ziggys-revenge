## About
This game was originally created in hopes of learning python and some basic game development, then spiraled into me making more video games and kind of tossing this one to the side indefinitely until I randomly got motivation to use this for a CCN project. After learning from YT tutorials from __DaFluffyPotato__, I started implementing my own features and sprites. Sprites took a while because I've never made pixel art before but I think they turned out pretty well. My dog, Ziggy, is the main protagonist in this story. 

## The future of Ziggy's Revenge
While I have no future plans of working on this game full time, I would like to implement some more features such as new enemies, attacks, tile blocks, decor, maybe even multiplayer.
